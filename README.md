I modified DenseNet and ResNet models to include the Convolutional Block Attention Module. I then trained and tested them as well as their base models, to recognize handwritten Chinese characters using the CASIA HWDB1.1 dataset.

Results on Testing Accuracy:
1. DenseNet with attention module
2. DenseNet (base)
3. ResNet (base)
4. ResNet with attention module
